# Secure Worker Architecture

`pdf.xyz` is browser-first. The secure-worker system exists only for operations the browser cannot do honestly or reliably: OCR, Office conversion, deep compression, repair, PDF/A, visual compare, irreversible redaction, e-signature workflows, and AI-assisted document intelligence.

This phase adds the **contract layer** for those workers. It does not pretend to process files yet.

## Current implementation status

| Layer | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Typed contracts | Implemented in `src/lib/jobs/types.ts` |
| Capability mapping | Implemented in `src/lib/jobs/capabilities.ts` |
| Request validation | Implemented in `src/lib/jobs/validation.ts` |
| Development route stubs | Implemented under `src/app/api/uploads` and `src/app/api/jobs` |
| Tool-page worker preview | Implemented in `src/components/tools/worker-preview.tsx` |
| Real processors / queues / storage | Planned, not enabled |

The API route handlers are intentionally **development contract stubs**. They validate shape, limits, MIME types, safe URL inputs, and tool eligibility, then return explicit “worker backend not configured” responses until storage and processors are connected.

## Contract endpoints

### `POST /api/uploads`

Creates short-lived upload slots for a worker-capable file-input tool.

Request shape:

```json
{
  "tool": "ocr-pdf",
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "scan.pdf",
      "contentType": "application/pdf",
      "bytes": 1048576
    }
  ]
}
```

The validator rejects:

- unknown tool slugs
- in-browser tools such as `merge-pdf`
- path traversal or path separators in filenames
- invalid MIME types
- unsupported MIME types for the selected tool
- too many files or oversized files
- URL-only tools such as `webpage-to-pdf`

### `POST /api/jobs`

Creates a job for a worker-capable tool once files have been uploaded, or directly for URL-input tools.

File-input example:

```json
{
  "tool": "ocr-pdf",
  "inputs": ["f_1234567890"],
  "options": { "language": "eng" },
  "idempotencyKey": "ocr:scan:1"
}
```

URL-input example:

```json
{
  "tool": "webpage-to-pdf",
  "options": { "url": "https://example.com/report" }
}
```

The URL validator blocks localhost, private IPv4 ranges, link-local/cloud metadata ranges, embedded credentials, non-http(s) protocols, and internal/local hostnames. Production workers must also enforce network egress rules; this edge validator is defense-in-depth, not the only SSRF protection.

### `GET /api/jobs/:id`

Returns typed job status once a real backend exists. Stub behavior is explicit and safe: invalid ids are rejected, and unknown jobs are reported without leaking implementation details.

## Job lifecycle

```text
create upload session
  → direct encrypted upload
  → create job
  → queued
  → malware scan
  → isolated processing
  → signed download
  → automatic deletion
```

Job states are defined by `JobStatus`:

- `queued`
- `scanning`
- `processing`
- `completed`
- `failed`
- `expired`
- `canceled`

Terminal states are encoded in `TERMINAL_STATUSES`, and `isDownloadReady()` centralizes the download readiness rule.

## Retention model

`DEFAULT_RETENTION` currently defines the contract:

- input TTL: 60 minutes maximum
- output TTL: 60 minutes maximum
- `persistsAfterJob: false`

Production storage must enforce lifecycle deletion independently of application code. UI copy should continue to say: files are uploaded only for secure-worker/AI tools, inputs are wiped after processing, and outputs expire automatically.

## Production worker plan

### 1. Upload/session service

- Mint single-use upload slots.
- Use pre-signed URLs scoped to one file and one session.
- Enforce file count, file size, total size, MIME, and abuse limits before upload.
- Do not pass uploaded bytes through the Next.js app server.

### 2. Encrypted object storage

- Store inputs and outputs in a private encrypted bucket.
- Partition by job/session id.
- Deny public listing.
- Add lifecycle rules that delete both inputs and outputs automatically.

### 3. Queue

- Use separate queues per processor class:
  - `pdf-structure`
  - `office-conversion`
  - `ocr`
  - `html-render`
  - `ai-document`
- Apply concurrency and memory limits per queue.
- Emit status changes and progress events.

### 4. Sandboxed processors

Each job runs in an isolated temporary directory/container. Recommended processors:

- LibreOffice for Office ↔ PDF conversion.
- OCRmyPDF/Tesseract or a managed OCR provider for searchable scans.
- qpdf/mutool/Ghostscript for repair, PDF/A, and deep compression.
- Playwright/Chromium for webpage/HTML capture.
- Purpose-built redaction pipeline that permanently removes content, not just overlays boxes.

### 5. Security controls

- Malware scanning before processing.
- No document contents in logs.
- Strict timeout and memory limits.
- No arbitrary file paths in requests or outputs.
- Network egress disabled by default; webpage-to-PDF is the only exception and still requires SSRF guards.
- Signed, expiring download URLs.
- Idempotency keys for retry-safe job creation.

## UI contract

Secure-worker and AI tool pages render a contract preview instead of a fake uploader. The preview shows:

- processing mode
- expected inputs and outputs
- pipeline stages
- file limits
- retention window
- “not yet enabled” status

Live in-browser tools do not call these endpoints.

## Definition of done for first real worker

A worker-backed tool is production-ready only when it has:

- Upload session creation.
- Direct-to-storage upload.
- Queue-backed job creation.
- Status polling.
- Signed output download.
- Automatic deletion verified by lifecycle policy.
- Tests for validation, job states, and one happy-path processor.
- Security review for input validation, egress, file handling, and logging.
