/**
 * POST /api/jobs — create a processing job.
 *
 * Validates a job request against the typed contract in "@/lib/jobs" (strict
 * tool/input/options/URL checks), then delegates to the active worker adapter
 * (see `@/lib/workers`). With no backend a well-formed request returns
 * `503 worker_not_configured`; the API never enqueues or fakes a completed job.
 * The developer-only local-dev worker runs supported jobs (compression) for
 * real and fails honestly when it cannot. See docs/WORKER_ARCHITECTURE.md.
