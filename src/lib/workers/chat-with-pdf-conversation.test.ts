/**
 * The follow-up path for `chat-with-pdf`, tested across the seam it has to survive.
 *
 * Every layer below the UI already accepted prior turns; the UI never produced any, so
 * `contextTurns` was 0 on every request ever made. A test that only restated this
 * module's own rules would pass just as happily with the feature broken, so these tests
 * use the REAL pieces on both sides:
 *
 *   - the answer is read out of a package built by the REAL engine, so a change to the
 *     package format fails here instead of silently returning `null` in a browser, and
 *   - the built context is validated by the REAL `parseChatOptions`, so if the
 *     contract's bounds move, this fails instead of the user's follow-up question.
